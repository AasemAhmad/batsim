- The Batsim command-line interface.
- The format of the Batsim input files.
- The communication protocol with the decision-making component.

........................................................................................................................

Unreleased
----------

- `Commits since v2.0.0 <https://github.com/oar-team/batsim/compare/v2.0.0...HEAD>`_
- ``nix-env -f https://github.com/oar-team/kapack/archive/master.tar.gz -iA batsim_dev``

Changed (**breaks protocol**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``SUBMIT_PROFILE`` has been renamed ``REGISTER_PROFILE``.
  Trying to register an already existing profile will now fail.
- ``SUBMIT_JOB`` has been renamed ``REGISTER_JOB``.
  Trying to register an already existing job will now fail.
  The possibility to register profiles from within a ``REGISTER_JOB`` event has been discarded:
  Now use ``REGISTER_PROFILE`` then ``REGISTER_JOB``.
- The content of the ``config`` object of the ``SIMULATION_BEGINS`` event has been changed.
  It is now flattened and contains the following keys:
  ``redis-enabled``, ``redis-hostname``, ``redis-port``, ``redis-prefix``,``profiles-forwarded-on-submission``, ``dynamic-jobs-enabled`` and ``dynamic-jobs-acknowledged``.

Changed (**breaks command-line interface**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removal of the ``--config-file`` option.
  Now specify your desired features by the Batsim CLI options.
- Removal of the ``--enable-sg-process-tracing`` option.
  You can now use ``--sg-cfg`` to do the same.
- ``--batexec`` has been renamed ``--no-sched``.
- ``--allow-time-sharing`` has been split into two options
  ``--enable-time-sharing-on-compute`` and ``--disable-time-sharing-on-storage``,
  as resource roles have been introduced.

Changed (**breaks workload format**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Profile types of parallel jobs has been renamed:
  - ``msg_par`` into ``parallel``
  - ``msg_par_hg`` into ``parallel_homogeneous``
  - ``msg_par_hg_tot`` into ``parallel_homogeneous_total``
  - ``msg_par_hg_pfs`` into ``parallel_homogeneous_pfs``

Added (new command-line options)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New ``--sg-cfg`` option, that allows to set SimGrid configuration options.
- New ``--dump-execution-context`` option,
  that dumps the command execution context on the standard output.
  This allows external tools to understand the execution context of a batsim command without actually parsing it.

v2.0.0
------

- `Commits since v1.4.0 <https://github.com/oar-team/batsim/compare/v1.4.0...v2.0.0>`_
- Release date: 2018-02-20
- ``nix-env -f https://github.com/oar-team/kapack/archive/master.tar.gz -i batsim-2.0.0``

Changed (**breaks protocol**)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``QUERY_REQUEST`` and ``QUERY_REPLY`` messages have been respectively renamed ``QUERY`` and ``ANSWER``.
  This pair of messages is now bidirectional (Batsim can now ask information to the scheduler).
  Redis interactions with this pair of messages is no longer in the protocol (as it has never been implemented).
- When submitting dynamic jobs (``SUBMIT_JOB``), the ``job_id`` and ``id`` fields should now have the same value.
  Furthermore, jobs id are no longer integers but strings: ``my_wload!hello readers`` is now a valid job identifier.
- Removal of the ``job_status`` field from ``JOB_COMPLETED`` messages.
- ``JOB_COMPLETED`` messages should now be sent even for killed jobs.
  In this case, ``JOB_COMPLETED`` should be sent before ``JOB_KILLED``.

Added
~~~~~

- Added the ``--simgrid-version`` command-line option to show which SimGrid is used by Batsim.
- Added the ``--unittest`` command-line option to run unit tests.
  Executed by Batsimâ€™s continuous integration system.
- New ``SET_JOB_METADATA`` protocol message, which allows to set set metadata to jobs.
  Such metadata is written in the ``_jobs.csv`` output file.
- The ``_schedule.csv`` output file now contains a batsim_version field.
- The ``energy_query`` test checks that ``QUERY``/``ANSWER`` work as expected for the ``consumed_energy`` request.
- Added the ``estimate_waiting_time`` QUERY from Batsim to the scheduler.
- The ``SIMULATION_BEGINS`` message now contains information about workloads:
  A map from workload identifiers to their filenames.
- Added the ``job_alloc`` field to ``JOB_COMPLETED`` messages,
  which mentions which machines have been allocated to the finished job.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The ``_jobs.csv`` output file is now written more cleanly.
  The order of the columns within it may have changed.
  Removal of the deprecated ``hacky_job_id`` field.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Numeric sort should now work as expected (this is now tested).
- Power stace tracing now works when the number of machines is big.
- Output buffers now work even if incoming texts are bigger than the buffer.
- The ``QUERY_REQUEST``/``QUERY_REPLY`` messages were not respecting the protocol definition
  (probably never tested since the JSON protocol update).
- Dynamically submitted jobs could not be used right away after being submitted
  (by the following events, or at least the events of the same timestamp). This should now be possible.

........................................................................................................................

v1.4.0
------

- `Commits since v1.3.0 <https://github.com/oar-team/batsim/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0>`_
- Release date: 2017-10-07
- ``nix-env -f https://github.com/oar-team/kapack/archive/master.tar.gz -i batsim-1.4.0``

Added
~~~~~

- New ``SUBMIT_PROFILE`` protocol message that allows the decision process to submit profiles dynamically.
- New ``msg_par_hg_tot`` profile type.
  This is an homogeneous parallel task whose computation and communications amounts are spread over all allocated nodes.
  They can be seen as optimistic moldable tasks.

........................................................................................................................

v1.3.0
------

- `Commits since v1.2.0 <https://github.com/oar-team/batsim/compare/v1.2.0...v1.3.0>`_
- Release date: 2017-09-30

Added
~~~~~

- Jobs walltimes are no longer mandatory.
  The ``walltime`` field of jobs can now be omitted or set to -1.
  Such jobs will never be killed automatically by Batsim.

........................................................................................................................

v1.2.0
------

- `Commits since v1.1.0 <https://github.com/oar-team/batsim/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0>`_
- Release date: 2017-09-23

Added
~~~~~

- The job progress is now sent through the protocol when jobs are killed on request.
  This is done via a new ``job_progress`` map in ``JOB_KILLED`` messages,
  which gives this information for all the jobs that have really been killed.
- New job state ``COMPLETED_WALLTIME_REACHED`` (separated from ``COMPLETED_FAILED``).

........................................................................................................................

v1.1.0
------

- `Commits since v1.0.0 <https://github.com/oar-team/batsim/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0>`_
- Release date: 2017-09-09

Added
~~~~~

- New job profiles ``SCHEDULER_SEND`` and ``SCHEDULER_RECV`` that communicate with the scheduler.
  New ``send`` and ``recv`` protocol events that correspond to them.
- Jobs now have a return code.
  Can be specified in the ``ret`` field of the jobs in their JSON description.
  Default value is 0 (success).
- New job state: ``COMPLETED_FAILED``.
- New data added to the ``JOB_COMPLETED`` protocol event.
  ``return_code`` indicates whether the job has succeeded.
  The ``FAILED`` status can now be received.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The ``repeat`` value of sequence (composed) profiles is now optional.
  Default value is 1 (executed once, no repeat).

........................................................................................................................

~~~~~

- Stated LGPL-3.0 license.
- Code cosmetics standards are now checked by Codacy.
- New PFS host. Associated with a new ``hpst-host`` command-line option.

  It allows the scheduler to change the state of jobs in Batsim in-memory data structures.
- The ``submission_finished`` notification can be cancelled with a ``continue_submission`` notification.
- New data to the ``SIMULATION_BEGINS`` protocol event.
  ``allow_time_sharing`` boolean is now forwarded.
  ``resources_data`` gives information on the resources.
  ``hpst_host`` and ``lcst_host`` give information about the parallel file system.
- New data to the ``JOB_COMPLETED`` protocol event.
  ``job_state`` contains the job state (as stored by Batsim).
  ``kill_reason`` contains why the job has been killed (if relevant).

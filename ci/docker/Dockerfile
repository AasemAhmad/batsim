# This Dockerfile is a lie. The actual container build script is there:
# https://framagit.org/batsim/batsim/-/blob/master/ci/docker/hooks/build

# In short, this container is built by loading a container tarball generated by Nix.
# The following expression should build the container:
# nix-build -A batsim-docker-master https://github.com/oar-team/nur-kapack/archive/master.tar.gz

# Just a line to pretend that this file is an actual Dockerfile.
